    <abstract>
      <t>This memo describes an algorithm for deterministically generating parameters for elliptic curves over prime fields offering high practical security in cryptographic applications, including Transport Layer Security (TLS) and X.509 certificates. It also specifies a specific curve at the ~128-bit security level and a specific curve at the ~224-bit security level.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Since the initial standardization of elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) in <xref target="SEC1"/> there has been significant progress related to both efficiency and security of curves and implementations. Notable examples are algorithms protected against certain side-channel attacks, various 'special' prime shapes which allow faster modular arithmetic, and a larger set of curve models from which to choose. There is also concern in the community regarding the generation and potential weaknesses of the curves defined in <xref target="NIST"/>.</t>

      <t>This memo describes a deterministic algorithm for generating cryptographic elliptic curves over a given prime field. The constraints in the generation process produce curves that support constant-time, exception-free scalar multiplications that are resistant to a wide range of side-channel attacks including timing and cache attacks, thereby offering high practical security in cryptographic applications. The deterministic algorithm operates without any input parameters that would permit manipulation of the resulting curves. The selection between curve models is determined by choosing the curve form that supports the fastest (currently known) complete formulas for each modularity option of the underlying field prime. Specifically, the Edwards curve x^2 + y^2 = 1 + dx^2y^2 is used with primes p with p = 3 mod 4, and the twisted Edwards curve -x^2 + y^2 = 1 + dx^2y^2 is used when p = 1 mod 4.</t>

    <section anchor="generation" title="Parameter Generation">
      <t>This section describes the generation of the curve parameter, namely A, of the Montgomery curve y^2 = x^3 + Ax^2 + x. The input to this process is p, the prime that defines the underlying field. The size of p determines the amount of work needed to compute a discrete logarithm in the elliptic curve group and choosing a precise p depends on many implementation concerns. The performance of the curve will be dominated by operations in GF(p) and thus carefully choosing a value that allows for easy reductions on the intended architecture is critical. This document does not attempt to articulate all these considerations.</t>

      <section title="p = 1 mod 4">
        <t>For primes congruent to 1 mod 4, the minimal cofactors of the curve and its twist are either {4, 8} or {8, 4}. We choose a curve with the latter cofactors so that any algorithms that take the cofactor into account don't have to worry about checking for points on the twist, because the twist cofactor is larger.</t>

        <t>To generate the Montgomery curve we find the minimal, positive A value such (A-2) is divisible by four and where the cofactors are as desired. The <spanx style="verb">find1Mod4</spanx> function in the following Sage script returns this value given p:</t>

    <section title="The curve25519 and curve448 functions">
      <t>The <spanx style="verb">curve25519</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">curve448</spanx> functions performs scalar multiplication on the Montgomery form of the above curves. (This is used when implementing Diffie-Hellman.) The functions take a scalar and a u-coordinate as inputs and produce a u-coordinate as output. Although the functions work internally with integers, the inputs and outputs are 32-byte strings and this specification defines their encoding.</t>

      <t>U-coordinates are elements of the underlying field GF(2^255-19) or GF(2^448-2^224-1) and are encoded as an array of bytes, u, in little-endian order such that u[0] + 256 * u[1] + 256^2 * u[2] + ... + 256^n * u[n] is congruent to the value modulo p and u[n] is minimal. When receiving such an array, implementations of curve25519 (but not curve448) MUST mask the most-significant bit in the final byte. This is done to preserve compatibility with point formats which reserve the sign bit for use in other protocols and to increase resistance to implementation fingerprinting.</t>

      <t>For example, the following functions implement this in Python, although the Python code is not intended to be performant nor side-channel free.  Here the "bits" parameter should be set to 255 for curve25519 and 448 for curve448:</t>

      <figure align="center">
        <artwork align="left"><![CDATA[
def decodeLittleEndian(b,bits):
    return sum([b[i] << 8*i for i in range((bits+7)/8)])

def decodeUCoordinate(u,bits):
    u_list = [ord(b) for b in u]
    if bits % 8:
        u_list[-1] &= (1<<(bits%8))-1
    return decodeLittleEndian(u_list,bits)

def encodeUCoordinate(u,bits):
    u = u % p
    return ''.join([chr((u >> 8*i) & 0xff) for i in range((bits+7)/8)])]]></artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>(EDITORS NOTE: draft-turner-thecurve25519function also says "Implementations MUST reject numbers in the range [2^255-19, 2^255-1], inclusive." but I'm not aware of any implementations that do so.)</t>

      <t>Scalars are assumed to be randomly generated bytes. For curve25519, in order to decode 32 bytes into an integer scalar, set the three least significant bits of the first byte and the most significant bit of the last to zero, set the second most significant bit of the last byte to 1 and, finally, decode as little-endian. This means that resulting integer is of the form 2^254 + 8 * {0, 1, ..., 2^(251) - 1}.  Likewise, for curve448, set the two least significant bits of the first byte to 0, and the most significant bit of the last byte to 1.  This means that the resulting integer is of the form 2^447 + 4 * {0, 1, ..., 2^(445) - 1}.</t>

      <t>Finally, encode the resulting value as 32 or 56 bytes in little-endian order.</t>

      <t>When implementing this procedure, due to the existence of side-channels in commodity hardware, it is important that the pattern of memory accesses and jumps not depend on the values of any of the bits of <spanx style="verb">k</spanx>. It is also important that the arithmetic used not leak information about the integers modulo p (such as having b*c be distinguishable from c*c).</t>

      <t>The cswap instruction SHOULD be implemented in constant time (independent of <spanx style="verb">swap</spanx>) as follows:</t>

      <figure align="center">
        <artwork align="left"><![CDATA[
cswap(swap, x_2, x_3):
      dummy = swap * (x_2 - x_3)
      x_2 = x_2 - dummy
      x_3 = x_3 + dummy
      Return (x_2, x_3)]]></artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>where <spanx style="verb">swap</spanx> is 1 or 0. Alternatively, an implementation MAY use the following:</t>

      <figure align="center">
        <artwork align="left"><![CDATA[
cswap(swap, x_2, x_3):
      dummy = mask(swap) AND (x_2 XOR x_3)
      x_2 = x_2 XOR dummy
      x_3 = x_3 XOR dummy
      Return (x_2, x_3)]]></artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>where <spanx style="verb">mask(swap)</spanx> is the all-1 or all-0 word of the same length as x_2 and x_3, computed, e.g., as mask(swap) = 1 - swap. The latter version is often more efficient.</t>

      <t>The <spanx style="verb">curve25519</spanx> function can be used in an ECDH protocol as follows:</t>

      <t>Alice generates 32 random bytes in f[0] to f[31] and transmits K_A = curve25519(f, 9) to Bob, where 9 is the u-coordinate of the base point and is encoded as a byte with value 9, followed by 31 zero bytes.</t>

      <t>Bob similarly generates 32 random bytes in g[0] to g[31] and computes K_B = curve25519(g, 9) and transmits it to Alice.</t>

      <t>Alice computes curve25519(f, K_B); Bob computes curve25519(g, K_A) using their generated values and the received input.</t>

      <t>Both now share K = curve25519(f, curve25519(g, 9)) = curve25519(g, curve25519(f, 9)) as a shared secret. Both SHOULD check, in constant time, whether K is the all-zero value and abort if so (see below). Alice and Bob can then use a key-derivation function, such as hashing K, to compute a key.</t>

      <t>The check for the all-zero value results from the fact that the curve25519 function produces that value if it operates on an input corresponding to a point with order dividing the co-factor, h, of the curve. This is not a problem in some protocols, but nor should any honest party in a Diffie-Hellman protocol send such a point.</t>
